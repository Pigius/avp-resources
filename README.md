# AVP Resources

Welcome to the `avp-resources` repository, the central hub for learning, using, and mastering Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP) and Cedar. This repository serves as a collective resource for developers, architects, and anyone interested in permissions management across AWS resources.

## Repository Goals

This repository aims to centralize:

- AWS CloudFormation templates for AVP setup.
- Terraform modules for AVP configuration.
- Informative blog articles on AVP/Cedar.
- Scenarios for hands-on implementation.
- And a growing list of additional relevant resources.

To start, take a moment to peruse the [AVP User Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/verified-permissions/) and familiarize yourself with the principal concepts and capabilities of AVP.

## Repository Organization

The repository is organized into specific sections for ease of navigation:

- `cloudformation/`: AWS CloudFormation templates for AVP. Read readme over there.
- `terraform/`: Terraform examples for AVP. Read readme over there.
