# AVP Getting started

This project was created for a [blog post](https://dev.to/aws-heroes/authorization-and-amazon-verified-permissions-a-new-way-to-manage-permissions-part-xiv-avp-getting-started-478f) about the [AVP getting started feature](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/amazon-cognito-customers-access-apis-verified-permissions/). It includes three things:

- `api.yml` - a CloudFormation template with mocked API endpoints.
- `authentication.yml` for setting up Cognito (including groups).
- `lambda_handler.js` - a Lambda function generated by the AVP getting started wizard. I am not the author of this code, and the code here may become outdated at any time.
